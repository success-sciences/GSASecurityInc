				</br><h3>Fiber Optics</h3>
				<p>High-speed cabling to keep up with your high-speed business. Our team of certified staff will help accelerate our technology by replacing your old copper cables with high-speed fiber optic cabling. </p>
				<p>The speed of your business is not slowing down. Many companies are switching to fiber optic networking for its ability to transmit large amounts of data with greater speed and fidelity over longer distances. Our certified technicians specialize in replacing your copper cables with high-speed optic cabling. </p>
				<p>Fiber optics offer:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Bandwidth – The sizable capacity of fiber optics allows for carrying high-speed signals over longer distances</li>
					<li>Speed – By utilizing a core that carries light to transmit data, fiber optic cables transmit signals at a speed that is only about 31% slower than the speed of light.</li>
					<li>Security and Reliability – Fiber is resistant to severe weather, temperature changes, moisture and does not present a fire hazard. Fiber is also distinguished for security attributes, as it is less susceptible to traditional forms of security breaches.</li>
					<li>Cost – With increased productivity and eliminated speed issues, companies that use fiber optics often see significant cost savings over time.</li>
					<li>Latency – Delays from processing high amounts of data are decreased with fiber-optic cabling. This leads to better voice quality for VoIP users, improved synchronicity between employees and improved downloading and uploading of large files.</li>

                                <p>Since 1986 Success Sciences has been helping its high-profile clients “Earn and Retain MORE Successful Customer Relationships”. We primarily achieve that through high-impact training solutions in the classroom and with unique simulation technology that accelerates any conversation-based performance (sales, service, coaching, collections, tech support…).</p>
                                <p>We improve sales and the customer experience, leading to significantly higher top line revenue, conversion rates, margin, customer loyalty and retention.

                                <p>1. Exceptional earning potential, flexibility, independence and the opportunity to collaborate and innovate with other thought leaders.</p>
                                <p>2. Enjoy being treated like a practice leader and business owner without needing to invest anything in franchise fees, lease an office, or run the back end of a business (billing, marketing, support…)</p>
                                <p>3. Our content, approach to customization, simulation learning platform, and overall process to change behavior have dramatically helped clients succeed and are part of the competitive advantages you would offer in addition to our track record and support.</p>

                                <h2><center>You can always design your opportunity by combining the roles in balance that works for you.</center></h2></br>
                                <p>We will provide the right person with exceptional tools to build a client base without needing to create all of their own intellectual capital, fund years of design and development and be pulled into the time and expenses for building infrastructure to support and manage a business.</p>
                                <p>This is a significant opportunity for you. We’ve invested in building exceptional training content, technologies, thought leadership and a terrific reputation.
